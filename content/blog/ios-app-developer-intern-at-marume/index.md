I interned at MaruMe, a startup company based in Berkeley, CA, as an iOS app developer to build a product review app (kind of like Yelp for products). This was an extension of a grad school project of the founders. Unfortunately, this company no longer exists anymore, but this was my first real world experience and I learned a ton from them.

I spent the first month watching lectures of The Complete iOS 9 Developer Course by [Rob Percival](https://www.udemy.com/user/robpercival/) (The course does not exist in Udemy anymore because it's an old content; Swift 2). Back then, I didn't even know about web development or how database worked, so the learning curve was pretty steep, but I managed to learn enough to make some changes to the app.

Here are some highlights of what I implemented:

- **Button Redesign**: This was the first task I performed in my career as a Software Engineer -- a simple UI change ðŸ˜‰. Although it was supposed to be simple, it didn't feel simple at all to me back then. Previously the `REVIEW` button in the card was filled. The task was to change its style from `filled` to `outlined`.

- **Profile**: I created an user profile page where they can review what products they reviewed. They can also check their followers and followees in the page.
