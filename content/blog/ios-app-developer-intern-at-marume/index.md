I interned at MaruMe, a startup company based in Berkeley, CA, as an iOS app developer to build a product review app (kind of like Yelp for products).

### 🌟 Highlights

Here are some of stuff I implemented during my summer internship at MaruMe.

#### ✍️ Button Redesign

I redesigned the appearence of the buttons so they look nicer.
