## iOS App Developer Intern at TeamLab

I joined [TeamLab](https://www.teamlab.art/)'s iOS app development team to build a shopping app for [BigCamera](https://www.biccamera.com/bc/main/), one of the largest electronics retailers in Japan (kind of like BestBuy).

### 🌟 Highlights

Here are some of stuff I implemented during my summer internship at TeamLab.

#### 📄 Tutotial

I created a tutorial view controller completely from scratch and attach it on top of the landing page. We display the tutorial pages when an user opens the app for the first time to help them understand what they can do with the app and how to use it.

#### 🦴 Skeleton

I implemented a skeleton loading component. It's the gray shining rectanble to indicate the page is loading.
