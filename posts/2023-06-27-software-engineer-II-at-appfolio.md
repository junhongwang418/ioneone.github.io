title: Software Engineer II at AppFolio

I was promoted from Software Engineer to Software Engineer II in August 2022.

I first joined AppFolio in June 2020 as a summer intern working on Lisa.
After a very successful internship focusing on WebSocket / GraphQL Subscription and completing my BS in Computer Science at UCLA, I joined AppFolio and the Lisa Team full time in May 2021.

I have become a key contributor to Lisa in a very short time after I started working. I participated in Lisa customer visits early 2022 after the covid situation allowed that, and developed a deep understanding of customer problems as well as the operator needs. I completed a redesign of the Lisa operator scheduling interface, addressing multiple bugs and feature requests from the operators and ops managers. I'm very interested in design patterns and for instance introduced the adapter pattern to the Lisa email integration. I lead by example to achieve high test coverages which allow me and the team safe refactoring.

I led the initial Lisa trial of a 3rd party tool [SourceGraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) which was successful to give better visibility across different github repos and I worked with the frontend team to expand the trial and transitioned the technical ownership to them.

Most recently I was a key contributor to spinning up a prototype for Revenue Management, which required me to learn Ruby on Rails, [RBS](https://github.com/ruby/rbs), [BFF pattern](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/), as well as the AppFolio ecosystem. I shared my learnings with the rest of the team in 2 tech presentations.

Here are some anonymous feedbacks I received from my teammates:

> Junhong has amazing velocity. He's not afraid of starting work he's completely unfamiliar with. He stays on top of alerts and he has fixed an incredible amount of tech debt.

> Excellent and productive developer with great domain knowledge and drive. Always happy to help out and proactive when it comes to bug fixes and refactors. Stewart of code quality.

> Fast on completing stories. Good understanding of software engineering principles and coding style. A lot of small changes, like the animated product logo, show passion for the product.
